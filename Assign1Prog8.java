/*8. Write a program in C++ to check overflow/underflow during various arithmetical operation.   
Sample Output:
Check overflow/underflow during various arithmetical operation :
Range of int is [-2147483648, 2147483647]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Overflow the integer range and set in minimum range : -2147483648
Increasing from its minimum range : -2147483647
Product is :1
Underflow the range and set in maximum range : 2147483647
Decreasing from its maximum range : 2147483646
Product is : 0
